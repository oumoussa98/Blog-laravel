## About this blog

it's my first simple blog that i built and my first project with laravel and vuejs 
it may containe erros or messy coding
i'm still learning new things and i'll upgrade it as much as i can

## Quik start
1: create a new database and call it blog
then use composer and run commande "php artisan migrate"
or you can set the your database connection and other settings from .env file
2: create a shorcut for storage folder in the public folder 
you can use composer "php artisan storage:link" or do it manually
so that you can store images
